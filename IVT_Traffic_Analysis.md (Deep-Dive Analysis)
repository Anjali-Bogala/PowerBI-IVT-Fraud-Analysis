Invalid Traffic (IVT) Pattern Analysis Report

Analysis Overview:
This report presents clear evidence and insights into how device spoofing metrics (IDFA/UA ratio) drive invalid traffic detection in ad campaigns. All findings are based on the data and dashboard visualizations available in this repository.

Chart Interpretations & Insights:

Chart 1: IVT Flagging Rate by Device Spoofing Intensity
![IVT Flagging Rate](dashboard_chart1.jpg)
Metric: Ratio bins vs percentage flagged as IVT
Insight: Over 83% of hours with ratios >2000 are flagged. Clean traffic dominates bins <500.

Chart 2: Daily Device Spoofing vs IVT Score Trend
![Daily Trend](dashboard_chart2.jpg)
Metric: Trends of IDFA/UA ratio and IVT score over days
Insight:Spikes in device spoofing correspond with peaks in detected invalid traffic.

Chart 3: Hourly IVT Flagging Frequency
![Hourly Flagging](dashboard_chart3.jpg)
Metric: Count of IVT flags per hour
Insight: Invalid traffic is concentrated in time windows, not uniformly distributed.

Chart 4: Yearly Overview: Total Device Spoofing and IVT Flagging
![Yearly Overview](dashboard_chart4.jpg)
Metric: Yearly aggregation of IDFA/UA ratio and total flagged traffic
Insight: Demonstrates larger seasonal or campaign-driven patterns.

Chart 5: Request Load and Device Spoofing Pattern Analysis
- Metric: Requests per IDFA vs total requests and spoofing ratio
- Insight: Periods of high request volume also show increased spoofing indicators.

 Slicers and KPIs
- Slicers allow users to filter metrics by date, spoofing bins, or flag status, enriching the analysis.
- KPIs highlight total flagged hours, flagging rate, and peak device spoofing — supporting operational tracking and fast response.

 Business Analysis
- Device spoofing is the most powerful predictor of invalid traffic.
- Fraud risk is episodic and can be monitored/prevented with threshold alerts.
- The dashboard enables all stakeholders—tech, business, and client teams—to immediately spot and respond to traffic quality threats.


Conclusion:
Clear, actionable visuals and metrics make fraud detection transparent. The dashboard design allows for rapid investigation, quality assurance, and data-driven strategy in digital campaigns.
